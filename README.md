Project Description

The Home Price Prediction project uses historical data to train a model that can predict the price of a house. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to achieve accurate predictions.


Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Testing various machine learning models to find the best one for predicting house prices.

Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

Data

The dataset used for this project includes:


Attributes: Features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, total square feet.

Source: Kaggle
